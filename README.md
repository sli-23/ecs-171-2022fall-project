The dataset is about car accident dataset in the USA from 2016 to 2021, which was collected using multiple Traffic APIs ([Reference](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents)). More introductions and discriptions of the dataset are included in our project Jupyter Notebook.

## Data Preprocessing

In the `wind_speed(mph)` column of the data, we decided to impute data. We used mean value of the Win_Speed(mph) to replace the NaN value in this column of data.
