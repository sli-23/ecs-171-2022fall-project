The dataset is about car accidents in the USA from 2016 to 2021, which was collected using multiple Traffic APIs ([Reference](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents)). 

## Abstract

Utilizing the car accidents that covered 49 states of the USA, the purpose of this project is to explore the independent variables, such as weather, humidity, wind speed, weather condition etc, to see whether they have significant impact to the cars severity, and develop reliable models to predict the cars severity in accidents. Before analyzing, we would use EDA to visualize the data, and help us better understand the data. We would use both supervised learning methods, such as neural network and linear regression, to evaluate the relationships between variables.

## Introduction

Accidents are unavoidable in peopleâ€™s lives, but we all do not want it to happen. A lot of factors can be analyzed for avoiding car accidents, such as the time it happens, start time and end time; the weather condition, whether it is rainy, cloudy, and, sunny; where it happens, whether this place is crowded or not. These factors can all be counted and concluded. So in this project, we will analyze the degree of which factor influencing by using data exploration and models.  

## Method

### Data Exploration
From the heatmap, we can see that there is not sepcific feature that has a strong correlation with `Serverity`.

From the two plots below, we see that Miami is the city that has the most number of car accidents and California is the state that has most accidents.

Majority of the car accidents collected in the dataset are from 2021 (53.1% of overall).

### Data Preprocessing
We decide to delete some categorical variables because they won't affect the severity of car accidents. In addition, in order to futher explore the reason behind a car accident, we will add some new variables, such as the driving time and the terrain, which are consisting of the `Start_Time` ,`End_Time`, `Start_Lat`, `End_Lat`, `Start_lng` and `End_lng`. What's more, considering the percentage of missing value, we decide to delete any variables which its percentage is over 15%.

Colunms to drop
1.   `ID`
2.   `Description`
3.   `Airport_Code`
4.   `Timezone`
5.   `Start_Time`
6.   `End_Time`             
7.   `Start_Lat`              
8.   `Start_Lng`             
9.   `End_Lat`            
10.  `End_Lng`
11.  `Street`
12.  `Country`
13.  `Weather_Timestamp`
14.  `City`
15.  `Zipcode`

Based on Null and missing values percentage, we also will delete:
1. `Number`
2. `Precipitation(in)`
3. `Wind_Chill(F)`

Given that we have over 2 millions observations, we removed the missing values of the following labels: `Civil_Twilight`, `Nautical_Twilight`, `Astronomical_Twilight`, and `Sunrise_Sunset`.

#### Dropping the NaN rows(We have very large dataset)
Given that we have 2 millions observations and only a few thousands of rows have missing value, it is okay to drop them.

#### Feature Engineering -- Wind Direction
In `wind direction column`, we observe that there are some duplicative values, such as SSE and SSW, which they can be reclassified to south so that we can turn them into dummy variables in future.

#### Feature Engineering -- Weather Condition
In order to simplify the `weather_condition` column, we look up some online resources.
According to road weather management program, it tells that snow/sleet, rain and fog are the main weather condition cause car accidents. Therefore, we are only going to focus on these weather conditions.

#### Feature Engineering -- Duration

```
data['End_Time'] = pd.to_datetime(data['End_Time'])
data['Start_Time'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Start_Time'])
data['Duration'] = data.End_Time - data.Start_Time
new_data['Duration'] = new_data['Duration'].dt.total_seconds()
new_data['Duration'] = new_data['Duration'] / 60
```



#### Convert catorical variables using Orinal Encoder
For `Wind_Direction`, we categorize wind direction to main 4 directions: north, west, south and east
For `Weather_Condition`, the description about weather is really in detail. After some researches, we decided to categorize weather condition into 6 main categories: rain, fog, snow, cloud, clear, and thunderstorms. These are the main causes in car accidents.
For columns contain boolean values and strings, such as `state` and `side`, we converted them to dummy value using ordinal encoder.
```
ord_enc = OrdinalEncoder()

new_data.iloc[:,11:27] = ord_enc.fit_transform(new_data.iloc[:,11:27]).astype(int)
new_data.iloc[:,29:] = ord_enc.fit_transform(new_data.iloc[:,29:]).astype(int)
```

#### Test and Split
Instead of spliting the data base on certain percentage, we decided to split data base on the year the acciendts occur.
We use accidents happened before 2020 as training data, and accidents happened in 2020 as testing data.
```
training_data = new_data[new_data["year"] < 2020]
test_data = new_data[new_data["year"] == 2020]
training_data = training_data.drop(['year'], axis = 1)
test_data = test_data.drop(['year'], axis = 1)
```

### Linear Regression Model
Before running the linear regression model, we classified severity into 2 classes: '1' and '0' which stand for high and low.
```
X_train, y_train = training_data.drop(columns=['Severity']), training_data['Severity']
X_test, y_test = test_data.drop(columns=['Severity']), test_data['Severity']

y_train = [0 if y <= 2 else 1 for y in y_train]
y_test = [0 if y <= 2 else 1 for y in y_test]
```
For serverity higher than 2, we classifed as high(1); if it is less than or equal to 2, we classifed as low(0).

### Neural network Model
For the first three layers, we used 16, 14, and 8 units respectively; and activation function 'relu'.
For the output layers, we used 5 units and 'softmax' as the activation.
```
nn_model = Sequential()
nn_model.add(Dense(units = 16, activation = 'relu', input_dim = 32))
nn_model.add(Dense(units = 14, activation = 'relu'))
nn_model.add(Dense(units = 8, activation = 'relu'))
nn_model.add(Dense(units = 4, activation = 'softmax'))
nn_model.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

## Evaluation
We use classificaiton_report and training, testing loss/error to evaluate our model.

Our first model is a linear regression model, we get a mean squared error at around 0.1045 for testing data and 0.187 for training data. We also achieved an accuracy of 90%.

Our second model is a neural network model, we were able to achieve accuracy of 86%.

### How is our model in fitting graph
Confusion Matrix
, training error vs test error. From the graph, it looks not good because the training and testing line are far away from each other. It shows a overfitting.
